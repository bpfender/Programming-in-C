Would have liked to do ast, semantic, multi-pass

(Had I implemented this differently,
I would have parsed each file in turn, making a record of each further file to be
parsed)
Would have like to do proper warnings for abort but requires multipass assessment

Tokens left does not check for closed brackets

Doesn't parse closing } well
